# Hollow Space
You wake up in a very dimly lit room, you feel like throwing up. You can't remember how you got here.
You slowly get up from the floor and take a look around. This place looks worn down. It surely has not been in operation for a couple of centuries.
You try to remember how you got here, but you can't seem to find anything in your head.
You see a nearby flashlight on a shelf. You pick it up but you notice that it doesn't have any power left. You find 2 batteries on a nearby shelf and you put on of them in.
With a small noise the flashlight turns on and you can finally see part of the room you are in.
You have one mission you think to yourself. Get out!
