# Game Mechanics to prototype

- **Darkness Pool**
  - Swallows Lights
    - Decrease intensity of all lights inside
  - Slows down player
  - Damage over time

- **Pushable Boxes**

- **Cables that electricity can travel through**
  - Various energy source (Light, Batteries, Buttons)
  - Charged cables emmit light

## My opinion on the game mechanics

### Darkness Pool
**Pros:** Pretty cool idea and could make for an interesting puzzle element.

**Cons:** Coding the light dimming resulted in the spaghettiest spaghetti code I've ever spaghettied. (fights against Player flashlight and was generally annoying to implement)

### Pushable Boxes
**Pros:** Simple to implement and can be used in a variety of ways.

**Cons:** Not very original.

### Cables that electricity can travel through
**Pros:** Could be used in a variety of ways and could be used to create some interesting puzzles.

**Cons:** Could be difficult to implement and could be difficult to make it clear to the player how it works.
Force-refreshing the wires when powered is really annoying to implement in a clean way.
